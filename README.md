# Butterfly-Pattern

This problem was solved by following steps:
1. The pattern was divided in half, top and bottom half. The bottom half was mirror image of the top half and vice versa.
2. We calculated the number of stars and spaces in each line and tried to find the relation between these data with the value of (i,j)
3. At each line, we found a number of stars + spaces + stars pattern and we formulated a pattern to create the logic.
4. At last we just mirrored the top half in the bottom half. We just ran our outer loop from "n" to 1.

Thank You.
